# Why I'm Going

<span class="dropcap">W</span>hen I planned this trip before the election, I knew I wanted to start on inauguration day. It seemed fitting to start my journey across the US in our nation's capital, our collective heart, the center of so much of our energy. I knew there would be protests there no matter who won, as there always are. I wanted to talk to people on both sides, angry and ecstatic.

[Hundreds of thousands](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/24/donald-trumps-inauguration-symbol-of-presidents-sp/) of people are expected to protest against Donald Trump on inauguration day.
